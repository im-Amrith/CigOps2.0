It's completely normal to feel that way, but I want you to know that you're strong and capable of getting through this. Take a deep breath with me and let's focus on the present moment - you're doing great so far, and you've only just started your smoke-free journey! Let's visualize your life as a non-smoker, with more energy and better health - what does that look like to you? What's one thing you can do right now to help calm your stress, like taking a short walk or practicing some stretching?",
