But here's the thing: you're not alone, and you're taking a huge step towards a healthier life. Stress can definitely make cravings stronger, but I want you to know that you've got this. You can get through this. One thing that might help is to take a few deep breaths with me - let's try inhaling for a count of four, holding for a count of four, and exhaling for a count of four. Can you do that with me right now? How do you think you'll feel after taking a few deep breaths?",
